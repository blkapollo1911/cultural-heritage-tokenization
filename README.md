#  "Cultural Heritage Tokenization" (Vyper)

## Description

## Key Features
- Fractional Ownership: Smart contract mints ERC-1155 tokens representing shared ownership.
- Vyper Security: Core logic in Vyper for gas efficiency and readability.
- Royalties for Creators: Ensures continuous compensation to artists and creators.
- Decentralized Exchange Integration: Enables peer-to-peer asset trading.

## Why This Matters
This project combines asset tokenization and cultural preservation, a perfect way to showcase Vyperâ€™s capabilities while demonstrating the power of blockchain for historically overlooked communities.

## Tech Stack
- Vyper (Smart Contract Logic)
- ERC-1155 (Multi-token standard)
- IPFS (Metadata Storage)
- Brownie (Development & Testing)
- OpenZeppelin (Security and Royalty Implementation)
